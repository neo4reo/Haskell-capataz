## Dependencies

You'll need to install [Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack), once installed, you can execute the `make` command.

You'll need to make sure you invoke `make format` and `make lint` when pushing changes, otherwise the Pull Request builder will fail.

## Open Commit Policy

This library has an open commit bit policy: Anyone with an accepted pull request gets added as a repository collaborator.

Please create a feature branch and open a pull-request early for any new features or documentation improvements.
