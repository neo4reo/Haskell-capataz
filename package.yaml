name: capataz
version: '0.0.0.1'
synopsis: OTP-like supervision trees in Haskell
description: |
  `capataz` enhances the reliability of your concurrent applications by offering
  supervision of green threads that run in your application.

  Advantages over standard library:

  * Links related long-living processes together under a common capataz
    supervisor, with restart/shutdown order

  * Set restart strategies (Permanent, Transient, Temporary) on `IO`
    sub-routines on a granular level

  * Set restart strategies on a pool of long-living worker threads (AllForOne,
    OneForOne)

  * Complete telemetry on the sub-routine lifecycle of your application (start,
    error, restarts, shutdown)
