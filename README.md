### Open Commit Bit

supervisor has an open commit bit policy: Anyone with an accepted pull request
gets added as a repository collaborator. Please try to follow these simple
rules:

* Commit directly onto the master branch only for typos, improvements to the
  README and documentation.

* Create a feature branch and open a pull-request early for any new features to
  get feedback.

* Make sure you adhere to the general pull request rules above.
